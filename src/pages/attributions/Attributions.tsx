      <p>
        The conceptualisation of the project emerged from the work of{' '}
        <b>Benjamin, Emilie, Louis-Jacques, Olivier, and Pascale</b>. Project modelling was led by{' '}
        <b>Louis-Jacques</b> and <b>Benjamin</b>. The synthetic genes used in the project were
        designed by <b>Olivier</b> and <b>Emilie</b>. The cloning experiments and the gene and
        plasmid construction and verification experiments were performed by <b>Emilie, Benjamin</b>,
        and <b>Pascale</b>.

      <Title title='Finance' />
      <p>
        To initiate the finances of our project, <b>Louis-Jacques and Florence</b> designed the
        partnership plan later used for sponsorship requests. Every team member was involved in the
        fundraising of the team, looking for sponsors and contacting both local and national
        companies and organizations (special mentions to{' '}
        <b>Louis-Jacques, Benjamin, Vivian, Olivier, Éléonore, Éloïse, Alexandre</b> and{' '}
        <b>Emilie</b>). Éloïse launched the GoFundMe page for the team. <b>Louis-Jacques</b> took
        care of the administration of finances.

      <Title title='Communication' />
      <p>
        Among the project’s communication tools, <b>Florence</b> designed the project’s visual
        identity, logo and color scheme. She will also spearhead the final presentation’s
        preparation and optimization, writing it with{' '}
        <b>Louis-Jacques, Olivier, Éloïse, Benjamin and Emilie</b>. <b>Florence</b> also planned the
        Wiki’s visual design and created all of its original visual elements. <b>Jonathan</b>{' '}
        programmed the entire wiki and participated in its design as well. Olivier was in charge of
        giving updates of our project to the iGEM Canadian Newsletter. <b>Louis-Jacques</b> and{' '}
        <b>Éloïse</b> were in charge of our social media accounts, which were a great way to let
        people know about our project. <b>Emilie, Louis-Jacques, Vivian and Benjamin</b> wrote and
        edited the script for the project’s promotional video.{' '}
        <b>Emilie, Louis-Jacques, Mathieu, Éloïse</b> and <b>Benjamin</b> took care of filming the
        video and <b>Florence</b> was in charge of editing it.

        Communication and sharing scientific knowledge are a major part of an iGEM project. One of
        the communication activities we organized is a science popularization activity presented to
        the young attendees of the Patro de Charlesbourg summer camp. <b>Mathieu</b> was in charge
        of coordinating the event; <b>Vivian, Éléonore, Élise, Éloïse, Louis-Jacques</b> planned out
        its program; <b>Florence</b> refined its communication aspects and made the concepts easier
        to grasp for the young audience. <b>Florence</b> also planned out the visual aids for the
        activities and made them with the help of <b>Vivian, Mathieu, Éloïse</b> and <b>Éléonore</b>
        . Finally, <b>Vivian, Florence, Emilie</b> and <b>Olivier</b> performed the activity with
        the children at the <i>Patro de Charlesbourg</i>.

      <p>
        <b>Éloïse</b> and <b>Éléonore</b> prepared the presentation for Mini Jamboree and attended
        it, presenting our project to other canadian teams and a jury.{' '}
        <b>Louis-Jacques, Emilie, Éloïse</b> and <b>Olivier</b> participated in collaboration
        meetings with <b>iGEM Patras, iGEM Stockholm</b> and <b>iGEM Thessaloniki</b> for the
        LevelUp Collab. <b>Louis-Jacques</b> was in charge of coordinating the teams efforts and
        making the leaflets design with the help of members from the other collaborating teams.

        Because our project aims to intervene into an ecological and economic problem, feedback and
        advice from experts were essential for us. Most of the team first met{' '}
        <b>Christopher Keeling</b>, to get feedback on our approach, and he also provided us with
        some ethics and ecological advice on our project. <b>Vivian</b> organized meetings with{' '}
        <b>Christian Hébert</b> and <b>Björn Hamberger</b> and <b>Michel Cusson</b> to have a better
        general vision of the issues and some advice on how to make people interested in our
        project.
